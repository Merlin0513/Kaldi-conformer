# Conformer Model Implementation in Kaldi

## Kaldi-conformer

### Overview

This project presents an implementation of the Conformer model, a state-of-the-art speech recognition architecture, using the Kaldi speech recognition toolkit. The Conformer model combines convolutional neural networks with self-attention mechanisms to achieve superior performance in automatic speech recognition tasks.

### Features

Implementation of Conformer blocks with multi-head self-attention and convolution modules.
Efficient convolutional subsampling for input data processing.
Integration with Kaldi's robust speech processing and GPU-accelerated computation capabilities.

### Requirements

Kaldi Speech Recognition Toolkit
C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)
CUDA Toolkit (for GPU acceleration, optional)
Additional dependencies listed in requirements.txt
